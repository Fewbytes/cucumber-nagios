require 'cuken/ssh'
# Place your custom SSH steps in this file.
# For a suite of reusable steps see the note below.
# Cuken's reusable steps are modelled on Aruba.
#
# NOTE:
# SSH sessions are set-up using the ssh-forever gem.
# Command and (local) file/directory interactions are
# described using Aruba steps.
#
# For an example see:
# ./cuken/features/ssh.feature
#
# For step definitions see:
# ./lib/cuken/cucumber/ssh.rb
#
# For the SSH api see:
# ./lib/cuken/api/ssh.rb
#
# To use the step definitions in your cucumber
# feature files, add to env.rb:

# Enjoy.
